``Landsifier`` is a Python based library to estimate likely triggers of mapped landslides.
The Beta version of library consitute three machine learning based method for finding the trigger of Landslide inventories.



1. Geometric feature based method
==================================
This method is based on using 2D landslide polygon shape properties for classification. This method calculates various geometric properties of landslide polygon and based on these geometric properties it classify trigger of landslide inventories


2. Topological feature based method
====================================

This method convert landslide polygon data to landslide polygon Images. These converted landslide images are used as a input to CNN for landslide classification



3.Image based method
=====================

This method convert landslide polygon data to landslide polygon Images. These converted landslide images are used as a input to CNN for landslide classification
