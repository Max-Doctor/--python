# Random Forest based Method

This Method used seven geometric propeties of landslide polygon that have been found useful for landslide classification. These properties are--

1. Area (A) of landslide Polygon
2. Perimetre (P) of Landslide Polygon
3. Ratio of Area (A) to Perimetre(P)
4. Convex hull based measures (Ratio of area of polygon to area of convex hull fitted to polygon)
5. Width of minimum area bounding box fitted to polygon
6. Eccentricity of ellipse fitted to polygon having area A and perimetre P
7. minor-axis of ellipse fitted to polygon having area A and perimetre P
